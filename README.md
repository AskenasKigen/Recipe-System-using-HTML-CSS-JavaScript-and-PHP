# Recipe-System-using-HTML-CSS-JavaScript-and-PHP
A small chain of delicatessens wanted to set up a web site to raise their profile and create an online community to share recipes, initially featuring ingredients which they sell. I had been approached as an independent web developer to create a functioning prototype web site.
Below is a list of the initial requirements the company wanted:
• A customer facing web front end allowing non registered users to search for and read recipes. • An admin area to manage recipes, authors and categories.
• Provide a contact form for users to send a message to the admin.
• Provide a facility for the admin to mail individual users or mail all of them at once.
